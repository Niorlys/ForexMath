    "# Random Variables \n",
    " \n",
    "When performing experiments, often we are interested in a quantitative characterization of the outcomes instead of the outcomes themselves. For example, when we toss two dice, we might be interested in the sum of the numbers that come up. In this case, we can build a function $X$ where $X(\\omega) = X((i,j)) = i+j$. Then, for instance, the event $A = \\{(1,2), (2,1)\\}$ can be stated as $\\{ \\omega: X(\\omega) = 3\\} = X^{-1}(\\{3\\})$. For assigning probabilities to the events mapped by $X$, we must allow $X$ to satisfy the \"natural\" condition specified by the following definition.  \n",

    "Let $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space. A function $X: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is called a random variable respect to $\\mathcal{F}$ if for every Borel set $B \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, we have \n",
    " $$X^{-1}(B) = \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega: X(\\omega) \\in B \\} \\in \\mathcal{F}.$$ \n",
    "  \n",
    "We called the condition \"natural\" because as we saw earlier, the way of stating events in terms of a random variable is through its preimage of Borel sets, and since we want to assign a probability measure to those evenets, it is natural to require that the preimage of Borel sets are measurable. It is not practical checking out that every possible preimage of $X$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$. It turns out that we can check that $X$ is a random variable by seeing whether the above definition holds for the class $\\mathcal{C}$ of sets that generate the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$. \n",

    "**Theorem 1.1** \n",
    " \n",
    "Let $X: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function, and let $\\mathcal{C}$ a class of subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ that generates the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra. Then, $X$ is a random variable respect to $\\mathcal{F}$, if and only if for every $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$, we have\n",
    " $$X^{-1}(C) = \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega: X(\\omega) \\in C \\} \\in \\mathcal{F}.$$  \n",

    "where $\\mathcal{F}$ is the $\\sigma$-algebra of the sample space $\\Omega$.\n",

    "**Proof:**  $\\Rightarrow$ Let's define $\\mathcal{G}=\\{A \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}): X^{-1}(A) \\in \\mathcal{F}\\}$. It is easy to prove that $\\mathcal{G}$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra. Since by assumption, $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{G}$, we have that $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) \\subset \\mathcal{G}\\subset \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{G}=\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$, and $X$ is a random variable. The other direction is trivial. \n",

    "An useful case is when $\\mathcal{C}$ is the class of intervals of the form $(-\\infty, x]$. Theorerem 1.1 from the first article states that Borel's $\\sigma$-algebra is generated by the class $\\mathcal{C} = \\{(-\\infty, x]: x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. This leads to the following corollary. \n",

    "**Corollary 1.2**\n",

    "Let $X: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function. Then, $X$ is a random variable if and only if for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have\n",

    "The above corollary is particularly useful to confirm that a function is a random variable, as we show in the following example. \n",
