    "# Random Variables \n",
    " \n",
    "When performing experiments, often we are interested in a quantitative characterization of the outcomes instead of the outcomes themselves. For example, when we toss two dice, we might be interested in the sum of the numbers that come up. In this case, we can build a function $X$ where $X(\\omega) = X((i,j)) = i+j$. Then, for instance, the event $A = \\{(1,2), (2,1)\\}$ can be stated as $\\{ \\omega: X(\\omega) = 3\\} = X^{-1}(\\{3\\})$. Another example, when someone is betting on a coin toss, earning the amount bet if the coin lands heads and losing double the amount bet if the coin lands tails. In this case, for an amount $n$, the net return can be stated as $X_n = n I_H - 2n I_T = n(3I_H -2)$, where $I_H$ is the indicator function of the event where the coin lands heads and $I_T$ is the indicator function of the event where the coin lands tails, and $I_T = 1 - I_H$. Informally, we say that a **random variable** is any real-valued function on the sample space $\\Omega$. For assigning probabilities to the events mapped by $X$, we must allow $X$ to satisfy the \"natural\" condition specified by the following definition.  \n",

    ">**Definition 2.1 (Measurable function)** Let $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space. A function $f: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R^p}$ is  $\\langle \\mathcal{F}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R^p}) \\rangle$ measurable, if for every Borel set $B \\subset \\mathbb{R^p}$, we have\n",

    ">**Definition 2.2 (Random Variable)**  Let $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space. A function $X: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R^p}$ is called a random variable if it is $\\langle \\mathcal{F}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R^p}) \\rangle$ measurable. This is; for every Borel set $B \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R^p})$, we have \n",

    "For simplicity, we take $p=1$ in the definition above, and when there is no ambiguity, we say only that $X$ is a random variable, assuming that preimages are taken with respect to the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra in $\\mathbb{R^p}$. We call the condition \"natural\" because, as we saw earlier, events defined through a random variable are described by the preimage of Borel sets. Since we assign a probability measure to these events, it is natural to require that the preimages of Borel sets be measurable. An inmediate example of randm variable is the indicator function of an event $A \\subset \\Omega$, given by $I_A(\\omega) = 1$ if $\\omega \\in A$ and $I_A(\\omega) = 0$ otherwise. If $B$ is any Borel set, then\n",

    "Since all the preimages of $I_A$ are in $\\mathcal{F}$, then $I_A$ is a random variable. However, verifying that every possible preimage of $X$ belongs to $\\mathcal{F}$  as we did for $I_A$ is impractical. Fortunately, we can check whether $X$ is a random variable by ensuring that this condition holds for a class $\\mathcal{C}$ of sets that generate the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",

    "The concept of independence can be extended to random variables, with the idea that for tow random variables $X$ and $Y$, the probability of $X$ taking a value in a Borel set $A$ is independent of the probability of $Y$ taking a value in a Borel set $B$. Formally, we have the following definition.\n",

    ">$$P(X\\in A, Y\\in B) = P(X\\in A)P(Y\\in B).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Borel sigma-algebra is generated by the sets of the form $(-\\infty, x]$, then the definition above is equivalent to say that for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we hvae the following proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Proposition 3.1 (Independence of random variables)** Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have that\n",
    ">$$P(X\\le x, Y\\le y) = P(X\\le x)P(Y\\le y).$$\n",
    "> In general, we say that a collection of random variables $\\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I}$ is independent if for all Borel sets $A_i \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ for all $i\\in I$, we have that\n",
    ">$$P\\left(\\bigcap_{i\\in I} (X_i \\le x_i)\\right) = \\prod_{i\\in I} P(X_i \\le x_i).$$\n",

    "Note that the last statement is the same as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_{(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)}$ is the joint CDF of the random variables $\\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I}$. \n",
    " \n",
    "An usefult concept about random variables is the concept of **indepentent and identically distributed** random variables.\n",

    "From school we all have an intuitive understanding of the \"average\", formally known as the arithmetic mean. Our final score was computed as an average of our scores in the different subjects, that way future reviewer of our academic performance could have an idea about how well(or bad) we did. In the end, the average\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "is a way to summarize the dataset into a single, representative number, aiming to capture the central tendency of that data. Now, suppose that there are values repeated in the dataset, let's say that the value $x_i$ occurs $n_i$ times in a dataset of size $m\\ge n$. Then, the average can be rewritten as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^n n_i x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{n_i}{m} x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\frac{n_i}{m}$ is the relative frequency of the value $x_i$ in the dataset. This way, the average can be seen as a weighted sum of the values in the dataset, where the weights are the relative frequencies of the values. In the long run, we can replace the relative frequencies by the probabilities of the values $x_i$ which can be interpreted as the values of a discrete random variable $X$. If we set $A_i=\\{X=x_i\\}$, then $X=\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\mathbb{1}_{A_i}$. Variables of this form are called **simple** as we define next, assuming that we have a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$. In what follows, we use the terms **Lebesgue integral** and **expectation** interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition 2.5 (Simple random variable)** A random variable $X$ is called simple if it can be written as $\\mathbb{S}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\mathbf1_{A_i}$, where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}$ for all $i=1,2,...,n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\mathbb{S}$ can have different representations. For instance, $\\mathbb{S}=I_{(0,1]} + 2I_{(1/2,2]} = I_{(0,1/2]} + 3I_{(1/2,1]} + 2I_{(1,2]}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition 2.6 (Expectation of a simple random variable)** Let $\\mathbb{S}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_i\\mathbf1_{A_i}$ be a simple r.v. on $(\\Omega,\\mathcal F,P)$. Its **expected value** (Lebesgue integral) is:\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> \\mathbb E[\\mathbb{S}] \\;=\\;\n",
    "> \\int_{\\Omega}\\mathbb{S}\\,\\mathrm dP\n",
    "> := \\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_i\\,P(A_i)\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the expected value of an indicator function of an event is the probability of the event, this is, if $A\\in\\mathcal F$, then $\\mathbb E[1_A] = P(A)$. The definition of the integral mirrors the “weighted average” idea from the introduction: each value $x_i$ is weighted by the probability of the event where it occurs. From now on, we adopt the following conventions: \n",
    "\n",
    " - Let $S(x)$ be a logical proposition. Then, we say that $S(x)$ is true almost surely (a.s.) if $P(S(x)\\text{ is false}) = 0$.\n",
    " \n",
    "The reader may verified that the integral of a simple random variable is well-defined, this is, it is independent of the representation of $\\mathbb{S}$. Also, the properties of this integral are simple to verify, and we list them in the following proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Proposition 2.7 (Properties of the integral)** Let $\\mathbb{S}$ and $\\mathbb{T}$ be simple random variables. Then,\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. (Linearity) For any positives constants $a$ and $b$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[a\\mathbb{S} + b\\mathbb{T}] = a\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{S}] + b\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{T}]$.\n",
    "> 2. (Monotonicity) If $\\mathbb{S} \\leq \\mathbb{T}$ a.s., then $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{S}] \\leq \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{T}]$.\n",
    "> 3. (Positivity) If $\\mathbb{S} = \\mathbb{T}$ a.s., then $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{S}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{T}]$.\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have defined the integral of basic kind of random variables (r.v), we proceed to define the integral of more general r.v. by approximating it using simple r.v and then making a limiting process. Let's start with the case of non-negative r.v. $X$. We want to approximate $X$ using simple r.v. with error less than $1/2^n$. The approximation procedure is as follows: \n",
    " \n",
    "1. For a given $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, we partition the range of $X$ into intervals of length $1/2^n$.\n",
    "2. For each $y = X(\\omega)$, if $y\\ge n$, then we approximate $y$ by $n$. If $y<n$, then $y$ must be in one of the intervals of length $1/2^n$, this is; $k/2^n \\le y < (k+1)/2^n$, for some integer $k=0,1,2,...,n2^n-1$. Then, we approximate $y$ by the infimum $k/2^n$. Note that if we multiply by $2^n$ in the last inequality, we get $k \\le 2^n y < k+1$, which is equivalent to $k = \\lfloor 2^n y \\rfloor$. This leads to the following simple r.v. :\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{S}_n(\\omega) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "n, & \\text{if } X(\\omega) \\ge n, \\\\\n",
    "\\displaystyle\\frac{\\lfloor 2^n X(\\omega) \\rfloor}{2^n}, & \\text{if } X(\\omega) < n.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",

    "The expected value is a numerical characteristic of a random variable. It represents the long-run average value and is often used as a predictor for the random variable  after a large number of experiments. Note that it does not predict the outcome of a single experiment, but rather the average outcome over a large number of trials. Based on the expected value, we can do some rational decisions very often. \n",

In finance, for instance, two investment opportunities may offer the same expected return, yet a risk-averse investor could still prefer one over the other. A common way to distinguish between them is to measure the typical deviation from the mean. A larger deviation signals greater exposure to randomness, whereas a smaller deviation indicates that outcomes cluster more tightly around the mean, making the distribution more predictable. The following concept is a great tool to measure the typical squared deviation(or dispersion) from the mean.\n",
